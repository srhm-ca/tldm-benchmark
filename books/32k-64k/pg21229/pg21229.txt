Thistle and Rose
A Story for Girls

By Amy Walton
________________________________________________________________________
A gently moving story for girls.  Anna is aged fifteen, and her father
needs to go abroad on business for a while.  Her mother had died before
Anna could remember.  Anna is to go to Dornton to stay while her father
is away, and she is looking forward to meeting her relatives, including
her grandfather, who had been estranged from her father for many years.

The grandfather is living quietly in a small house "with no servants"
and has a job as organist in Dornton church.  He is well-known as an
excellent teacher of music, especially the violin.

The story goes on from there.  The book is not a long one, and the
audiobook takes a little over four hours. NH
