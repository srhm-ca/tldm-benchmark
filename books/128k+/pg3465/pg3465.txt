UNDER TWO FLAGS

by Ouida [Louise de la Ramee]


TO COLONEL POULETT CAMERON whose family has given so many brilliant
soldiers to the armies of France and England and made the battle-fields
of Europe ring with “The War-Cry of Lochiel” this story of a soldier's
life is dedicated in sincere friendship.




AVIS AU LECTEUR.

This Story was originally written for a military periodical. It has been
fortunate enough to receive much commendation from military men, and
for them it is now specially issued in its present form. For the general
public it may be as well to add that, where translations are appended to
the French phrases, those translations usually follow the idiomatic and
particular meaning attached to these expressions in the argot of the
Army of Algeria, and not the correct or literal one given to such words
or sentences in ordinary grammatical parlance.

OUIDA.
