PREFACE.


Everybody has sympathized with Mr. Dick who could not keep King
Charles’s head out of his memorial, and I hope everybody will
sympathize with me who have been unable to keep Betty Alden in this her
memorial so constantly as I wished and she deserved. But as the whole
includes the less, her story will be found threaded through that of her
people and her times in that modest subordination to which the lives
of her sex were trained in that day. He who would read for himself the
story of this noble woman, the first-born daughter of the Pilgrims,
must seek it through ancient volumes and mouldering records, until at
Little Compton in Rhode Island he finds upon her gravestone the last
affectionate and honorable mention of Elizabeth, daughter of John and
Priscilla Alden, and wife of William Pabodie. Or in lighter mood, he
may consider the rugged rhyme tradition places in her mouth upon the
occasion of the birth of her great great grandchild:--


     “Rise daughter! To thy daughter run!
     Thy daughter’s daughter hath a son.”


One word upon a subject which has of late been a good deal discussed,
but by no means settled, and that is, the burial place of Myles
Standish. In the absence of all proof in any such matter, tradition
becomes important, and so far as I have been able to determine, the
tradition that some of the earliest settlers were buried in the
vicinity of a temporary meeting-house upon Harden Hill in Duxbury is
more reliable than the tradition that Standish was laid in an old
burying ground at Hall’s Corner which probably was not set aside as a
burial place in 1656, the date of his death.

It is matter of surprise and regret to most persons that the Pilgrims
took so little pains to perpetuate the memory of their graves, and
their doing so would have been a wonderful aid to those who would read
the palimpsest of the past. But a little recollection diminishes the
wonder, if not the regret. Practically, the Pilgrims had neither the
money wherewith to import gravestones, nor the skill to fashion and
sculpture them; ethically, their lives were fashioned after an ideal,
and that ideal was Protestantism in its most primitive intention, a
protest against Rome, her creeds and her usages; prayers for the dead
were to them a horrible superstition; Purgatory a mere invention of
the powers of hell; an appeal to saints, angels, or the spirits of the
departed was a direct insult to the Divine Supremacy. The instant the
soul left the body Protestantism decreed that it was not only useless
but profane to follow it with prayers (much less masses), or with any
other remembrance which might be construed as intruding upon “the
counsels of the Almighty,” so that while private grief was sternly
rebuked as rebellion against the chastisements of a just and offended
God, every form of funeral service, domestic or congregational, was set
aside as superstitious and dangerous.

The only exceptions to this rule were the volleys of musketry fired
over the graves of certain of the leaders, as Carver, Standish,
Bradford, and a few others, but these stern military honors were
unaccompanied by even the prayer of a chaplain.

It was perhaps not altogether from fear of the Indians that the fifty
of the Mayflower Pilgrims who were left alive that first spring
smoothed the graves of the fifty who were gone, and planted them to
corn; possibly they also feared their own hearts, sorely tempted by
nature to cherish and adorn those barren graves where so much love and
hope lay buried; and any step in that direction was a step backward
from that “city” they had crossed the seas to seek in the wilderness.

It is I think certain that not one of the original Pilgrim graves was
marked by any sort of monument. The few we now delight to honor were
identified by those of their children to whom the third generation
erected tablets. A few persons, of loving and unbigoted hearts, begged
to be buried beside their departed friends, and Standish in his last
will allowed a sunset gleam of his tender nature to shine out when
he asked to be laid as near as conveniently might be to his two
dear daughters; but neither he nor any of the others who made this
testamentary petition mentioned where the graves were, beside which
they fain would lie, nor in any one instance have they been positively
identified. That of Elder Brewster, concerning whose burial we have
many particulars, is altogether unknown, except that it seems to have
been made upon Burying Hill. Perhaps that of Standish is there also,
for when he says,--“If I die at Duxburrow I should like,” etc., he may
mean that if he dies in Duxbury he would fain be carried to Plymouth,
there to lie beside his daughters and very likely his two little sons
as well.

But to me it seems a small matter, this question of the grave of
Standish. He lived to be old and very infirm, and neither his old age,
his infirmities, nor his final surrender to death are any part of his
memory. For me, he stands forever as he stood in his glorious prime
among the people he so unselfishly championed, a tower of strength,
courage, and endurance, the shining survival of chivalry, the gallant
paladin whose coat-armor gleams amid the throng of russet jerkins
and mantles of hodden gray, like the dash of color with which Turner
accents his wastes of sombre water and sky. So let him stand, so let
us look upon him, and honor him and glory in him, nor seek to draw
the veil with which Time mercifully hides the only defeat our hero
ever knew, that last fatal battle when age, and “dolorous pain,” and
fell disease, conquered the invincible, and restored to earth all that
was mortal of a magnificent immortality. We cannot erect a monument
over that forgotten grave, but in some coming day let us hope that
the descendants of the soldier Pilgrim will possess themselves of the
little peninsula where the site of his home may still be traced, and
there place some memorial stone to tell that on this fairest spot of
fair Duxbury’s shore lived and died the man who gave Duxbury her name,
and bequeathed to us an inheritance far richer than that which was
“surreptitiously detained” from him.
